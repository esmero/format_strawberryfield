A Drupal 8 module that provides Cool Field Formatters for StrawberryField (JSON) fields. This is part of the Archipelago Commons Project.

## How to install citeproc-php dependencies

We include [citeproc-php](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php) in this module as a Twig extension and field formatter to generate citations and bibliographies, but its dependencies need to be installed to use it:

```shell
docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'drush archipelago-download-citeproc-dependencies'
```
